**Grade Achieved**: **8.00**

## Overview  

This repository contains the final prototype for the **SBC (System Based on Rules)** practice. The system is implemented using the CLIPS environment and provides recommendations based on user input.

## How to Run

   ```
2. **Reset the environment**:  
   ```clips
   (reset)
   ```
3. **Run the system**:  
   ```clips
   (run)
   ```
4. **Interact with the system**:  
   - Answer the questions prompted by the system.  
   - Receive a recommendation based on your responses.

### Example Command Sequence  
```clips
(load ontologia_v4.clp)  
(reset)  
(run)  
... -> Respond to the system's questions.  
```

## File Structure
